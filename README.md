# How to Play

To advance through the game, you must destroy all approaching enemies on the screen.

Your score will grow through your interactions in the game. Coming back from death, and purchasing Follower Rockets will cost score, be warned!

Enemies will drop abilities:

The <b> orange sword </b> will grant you faster shooting

The <b> red heart </b> will restore a portion of your health

The <b> hourglass </b> will slow time

The <b> blue shield </b> will grant invincibility

Abilities are stored in <b> spell slots </b> on the bottom right corner of your screen. You may hold two at a time. 
If spells are left in space, they will disappear after a period of time.

When asked for your name, type your name and then press enter. The text will then reveal itself.
